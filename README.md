# Near - Lottery

This repository is inspired by the Lottery game on the Lear-Near repository. This is a game DApp built on Near blockchain. The smart contract for this game is written with AssemblyScript.


The goal of this repository is to make it as easy as possible to get started writing unit test for AssemblyScript contracts built to work with NEAR Protocol.
